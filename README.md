Sudoku Mentor
Sudoku Mentor is an advanced, React-based Sudoku application designed to help players move beyond basic solving and master complex logical techniques. Unlike standard Sudoku games, this app acts as a tutor, providing step-by-step logical explanations for even the most difficult puzzles.

🌟 Key Features
Logic Engine & Tutor: Automatically identifies and explains advanced techniques like X-Wings, XY-Chains, ALS (Almost Locked Sets), and Forcing Chains.

"Ghost Mode" Visualization: Instead of static arrows, the mentor uses a dynamic "What-If" ghosting system. It places temporary, styled candidates on the grid to demonstrate how a hypothesis leads to a placement or a logical contradiction.

Step-by-Step Playback: Step through long logical chains at your own pace to visualize exactly how the board state evolves during complex deductions.

Unified Puzzle Loader: Load puzzles from a library, input them manually as text strings, or use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to import puzzles from images.

Customizable Experience: Fully adjustable color settings for candidates, focus digits, and grid lines to suit your visual preferences.

🚀 Technical Stack
Frontend: React with Vite for high-performance development.

Styling: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI for a sleek, dark-mode-first interface.

Animations: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and logical highlights.

Logic Engine: Custom-built JavaScript engines for candidate generation, constraint propagation, and deep search for forcing chains.# Base44 App
